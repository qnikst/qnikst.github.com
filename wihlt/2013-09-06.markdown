  * Had a nice discussion why Alternative has no (Monoid m, Applicative m) constraint.
    (Just look at the kinds they are different)

        λ> :k Monoid
        Monoid :: * -> Constraint
        λ> :k Applicative
        Applicative :: (* -> *) -> Constraint

  * Done: path finding algorithm


## what puzzeles me (new questions):
  
  * It worth of writing a post on pathfinding;
  * I need to read articles about repa and understand tutorials;
  * I need to have basic undestanding of [http://okmij.org/ftp/meta-programming/HPC.html]
  * K-means example still not work for me;

## list of pending questions
  * Treadscope fails for me with strange errors (should be debugged and possibly fixed) (2013-09-04);
  * I need to blogpost about biegunka once I'll have good config (2013-09-05);
  * Write git-annex usecases I want to implement in order to ask how can I archive them. (2013-09-04)
  * How to use zippers to work with trees (see ndtimofeev questions on [juick](http://juick.com/ndtimofeev/2504504)) (2013-09-05)
  * how to include list of pending questions on all WHILT pages without troubles (2013-09-05)

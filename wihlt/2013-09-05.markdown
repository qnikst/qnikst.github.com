  * I've fixed gentoo-haskell repo for me, and now it's possible to run normal workflow.

## what puzzeles me (new questions):

  * I had not managed to run k-means example in distributed-haskell tutorial by well typed.
  * is it possible to use comonad for simplifying breadth-first/A* algorithms
    via [LOR](http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/development/9550013)
  * how to include list of pending questions on all WHILT pages without troubles
  
## list of pending questions
  * Treadscope fails for me with strange errors (should be debugged and possibly fixed);
  * I need to blogpost about biegunka once I'll have good config;
  * Write git-annex usecases I want to implement in order to ask how can I archive them.
  * How to use zippers to work with trees (see ndtimofeev questions on [juick](http://juick.com/ndtimofeev/2504504))

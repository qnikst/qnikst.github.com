  * It's possible to input special character using digraph vim extension:
      [http://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=443](). Keys: ^k. Greek characters
      can be entered as `<latin character>+*`.

  * It's possible to use threadscope to collect stats from different nodes by
    using `ghc-event merge`.
      
  * I've started to use zsh once again. Config was "stolen" from [kriegstask's dotfiles](https://bitbucket.org/skrattaren/dotfiles)

  * I've started to use biegunka for storing dotfiles. See 
    [official site](http://biegunka.budueba.com/) and 
    [project repo](https://github.com/biegunka/biegunka).

## Pending questions:

  * Treadscope fails for me with strange errors (should be debugged and possibly fixed);
  * I need to blogpost about biegunka once I'll have good config;
  * Write git-annex usecases I want to implement in order to ask how can I archive them.
  * How to use zippers to work with trees (see ndtimofeev questions on [juick](http://juick.com/ndtimofeev/2504504))

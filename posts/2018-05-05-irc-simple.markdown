Few months ago one person asked me in twitter how is it
possible to write anything in Haskell, and how can it
help to write some low level application working with network.

As a result I've ended up with a simple non-complete
`irc-simple` project. This project can't be used as a real
irc server in the real network. But it can be extended to
support features. The main intent was to show how server
could be written how to deal with communication, parsing,
concurrency.

Unfortunately the project is documented in Russian, as it
was written for the Russian non-haskell community. But
if anyone would be interested in extending, translation or
mistakes correction. That would be awesome.

Project itself can be found on:
